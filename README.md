# SelfAssignments
Coding helps me learn, so I'm creating this big mono-repo to experiment with concepts I don't understand well

## How to reproduce
In a future commit, I will add a docker method to reproduce my code. Until this, it will be strictly tied to flakes.

To reproduce the results in one line
```bash
nix build
```

To use the environment
```bash
nix develop
```
